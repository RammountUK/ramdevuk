NPS was supplied with Samsung Galaxy Tab Active3s, Tab Active2s, Tab Active Pros and XCover Pros wrapped with RAM® Skin™ protective sleeves and equipped with GDS® Ergo™ accessories such as a shoulder strap, kickstand and hand strap. These products allowed the NPS team to keep their devices protected, and secured safely on their person in order to use GPS mapping and GIS software out in field with ease of use. After finishing data collection, they could transfer the devices to a RAM® charging dock in their service vehicle, boat, or ATV until arriving back at the office. Once connected to the NPS network, they ran Samsung DeX, mirroring the Tab Actives to external monitors for a desktop experience—propped up with the GDS® Hand-Stand™. In addition, data could be instantly consolidated into the tablet by connecting various instruments to the GDS® Hub™, all at the same time. This new efficient workflow allowed the NPS team to embrace the increasingly browser-based geospatial environment significantly cutting data processing time and equipment cost.<\/p>","text_color":"#000000","button_text_color":"#000000","button_text_color_hover":"#ffffff","mobile_heading_font_size":"text-xl","desktop_heading_font_size":"md:text-xl","mobile_content_font_size":"text-sm","desktop_content_font_size":"md:text-sm","copy_bottom_spacing":8,"desktop_col_span":"md:w-1\/2","column_text_alignment":"text-left"}},"4c227b69-f4a6-47eb-918f-3dd1ca41fa9f":{"type":"multicolumn-text","settings":{"heading":"<p>The Benefits<\/p>","copy":"<p>RAM® products are the most durable mounting solutions on the planet with the toughest designs for both charging and non-charging solutions.
